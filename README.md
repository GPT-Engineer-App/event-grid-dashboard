# event-grid-dashboard

A dashboard in a three by three grid format, which allows users to input the title and date of an event. The program should display the days until or since the event with the title on the dashboard. Each cell in the grid will follow the snapshot provided: with the title in a smaller font, the number in a large font, the 'days till' dates in green, and the 'days since' dates in yellow. The background is a dark teal color, the fonts appear to be sans-serif, and the title 'Electric Bill' is in white while the number '46' is in green.
